dear kcorrectors:

tired of your old kcorrect code? frustrated with bad k-corrections for
galaxies at z=0.3? fuming about overly smoothed SEDs being fit to your
photometry? photo-z outliers irritating you again? we have a solution:
kcorrect v3_1b, a beta version of a better way for all kcorrectors!

the main improvement is a move to non-negative linear combinations of 
templates, which is a better behaved constraint on the fits. this has
the consequences:

  1. degeneracies that afflicted old versions are now gone
  2. photo-z outliers are greatly reduced 
  3. extrapolations of the fit are less dangerous

eventually, this will provide us the tools to return physical
parameters to associate with the photometry and simple evolution
estimates.

the second improvement is a simpler mechanism for including other
filter systems, so that you can easily run kcorrect on (for example)
2MASS data. 

i encourage everybody to use this and let me know how they like it. i
have linked the new documentation off of the page with the old
documentation (at http://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/kcorrect). i am
especially interested in recommendations on the documentation.

thanks,
mike blanton
