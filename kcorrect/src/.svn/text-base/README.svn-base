This directory contains routines which calculate K-corrections. 

A number of C routines are provided which can be easily incorporated
into your C code. Simply remove -DIDL_ROUTINE from the Makefile in
order to build the C shared object library independently of IDL.

Wrappers are also included which make the code callable from IDL. 

There are routines included from exterior libraries, in particular
from LAPACK, BLAS, and Numerical Recipes. These routines are all given
the "k_" prefix in order to avoid overloading the routine names, which
you might be using in your own code.
