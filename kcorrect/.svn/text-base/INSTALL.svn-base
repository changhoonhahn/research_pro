Installation instructions, kcorrect, MRB 2003-07-18
===================================================

1. Set the environmental variables. 

   In bash (good to put it into .bash_profile):
      KCORRECT_DIR=/usr/local/kcorrect
      PATH=$KCORRECT_DIR/bin:$PATH
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$KCORRECT_DIR/lib
      export KCORRECT_DIR 
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
      IDL_PATH=$IDL_PATH:+$KCORRECT_DIR/pro
   
   In tcsh (good to put it into .tcshrc):
      setenv KCORRECT_DIR /usr/local/kcorrect
      setenv PATH $KCORRECT_DIR/bin:$PATH
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$KCORRECT_DIR/lib
      setenv IDL_PATH ${IDL_PATH}:+$KCORRECT_DIR/pro

   EvilUPS or UPS users need only type:
      setup -r /usr/local/kcorrect kcorrect
   or if they have put the product into the EvilUPS system:
      setup kcorrect

   Replace /usr/local/kcorrect with wherever you happen to have
   put the kcorrect product (eg. $HOME/kcorrect). 
   Only IDL users need set the IDL_PATH variable.

2. Build the code

   cd $KCORRECT_DIR
   kevilmake -k all

3. Use the code. You should have the stand-alone C programs built now
   and you should be able to use the IDL code from IDL.
