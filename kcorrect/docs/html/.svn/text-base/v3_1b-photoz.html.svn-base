<H1> Photometric Redshifts</H1>
 
<p> Once one has constructed the SED templates, it is trivial to use
them to calculate photometric redshifts. </p>

<p> Fitting photometric redshifts just requires fitting the
coefficients for a number of redshifts and minimizing the chi^2
residuals for the fits. I provide routines here to do so. They take
about 70 ms an object on a 1GHz Pentium III and are reasonably
accurate -- the 5-sigma clipped estimate of the redshift errors is
about 0.05. </p>

<p> A piece of advice on the *type* of magnitudes to use for
photometric redshifts. For modern versions of PHOTO (v5_4 and later)
it is best to simply use the model magnitudes for all galaxies. </p>

<p> The IDL routine <b>kphotoz</b> works in a way which is extremely
similar to the <b>kcorrect</b> routine.
<pre>
IDL> kphotoz
Syntax - kphotoz, maggies, maggies_ivar, photoz [ , $
             /magnitude, /stddev, lfile=, zmin=, zmax=, nz=, $
             vfile=, vpath=, filterlist=, filterpath=, rmatrix=, $
             zvals=, lambda=, vmatrix=, coeffs=, /verbose, $
             lprior=, zprior=, /noprior, /sdssfix ]
</pre>
For example, one might do the following:
<pre>
kphotoz, [1., 4.78, 10.96, 14.45, 19.05],  $
         [1100., 28., 7.7, 4.4, 2.5], $
         photoz
</pre>
</p>
Again, there is large overhead, so one-at-a-time is not the way to
call <b>kphotoz</b>. As for <b>kcorrect</b>, you can avoid spending
this overhead more than once either by feeding it lists of objects or
as follows:
<pre>
kphotoz, [1., 4.78, 10.96, 14.45, 19.05],  $
         [1100., 28., 7.7, 4.4, 2.5], $
         photoz, rmatrix=rmatrix, zvals=zvals
kphotoz, [1., 4.78, 10.96, 14.45, 19.05],  $
         [1100., 28., 7.7, 4.4, 2.5], $
         photoz, rmatrix=rmatrix, zvals=zvals
</pre>
Finally, the /sdssfix option fixes SDSS magnitudes in the same way as
for <b>kcorrect</b>.

<p>By default, <b>kphotoz</b> uses a very simple prior (equal to the
redshift z) to push the fits away from z=0. You can turn this off with
the flag /noprior, or specify your own prior using the inputs zprior
(which indicates the redshift grid) and lprior (which indicates the
natural log of the prior). </p>

<p> The stand-alone program <b>fit_photoz</b> works in the same way as
<b>fit_coeffs</b>: 
<pre>
apeiron.[v3_1].27 % fit_photoz --help
Usage: cat <maggies file> | fit_photoz [--vfile <vfile> --lfile <lfile>
            --ffile <ffile> ]
</pre>
As in:
<pre>
cat maggies.dat | fit_photoz 
</pre>
where in this case each line of "maggies.dat" has the form:
<pre>
umaggies gmaggies rmaggies imaggies zmaggies uinvvar ginvvar rinvvar iinvvar zinvvar
</pre>
The output is again to standard out and is of the form:
<pre>
photoz coeff0 coeff1 coeff2
</pre>
The same rules apply here as to the IDL code: call the code for many
objects at a time, or else the overhead (about 3 seconds) will kill
you.
</p>

<p> The photo-z code can also be accessed through the C library
libkcorrect.so. Follow the directions in the <a href="v3_1b-index.html">
main page</a> for using this library. Instead of <b>k_fit_coeffs</b>,
you will be calling <b>k_fit_photoz</b>, as in:
<pre>
k_fit_photoz(photoz, coeffs, rmatrix, nk, nv, zprior, lprior, nprior, 
             zvals, nz, maggies, maggies_ivar, ngalaxy, tolerance,
             maxiter, niter, chi2, verbose)
</pre>
zprior, lprior, and nprior should contain the prior grid to use.
</p>

<p> Please note that the photometric redshifts resulting from this
code are not in any sense "official" SDSS photometric redshifts. They
have not been subject to the care and scrutiny given to the official
photometric redshifts. In addition, they should be used with due
regard to the correlations between errors in type and errors in
redshift, as well as the systematic errors associated with photometric
redshifts. </p>

<p> Finally, this code can be (almost) trivially adapted to any
optical photometry results for galaxies in the redshift range 0 to
0.5. All you need to do is to specify a different set of filters, make
sure your magnitudes are AB, and plug away!</p>
