ABSTRACT

We announce the availability of UV-optical spectra of 99 galaxies, the
list of which is given at the bottom of this README file according to
activity type: 1. quiescent galaxies (subdivided in ellipticals and
spirals/later types) and 2. "active" galaxies (subdivided in
starbursts/HII, Seyferts, and LINERs/mixed types). In summary, the
available data consist of IUE UV (1200--3300A) spectra combined with
ground-based optical spectra obtained with a matched aperture
(10"x20").  Some of the quiescent galaxy spectra, the starburst and
Seyfert 2 spectra have been already presented in McQuade, Calzetti &
Kinney (1995, ApJS 97, 331) and Storchi-Bergmann, Kinney & Challis
(1995, ApJS 98, 103). The optical spectra cover the range 3200-7500A
for the Northern Hemisphere galaxies and the range 3200-10000A for the
Sourthern Hemisphere galaxies.

===============================================================

REMARKS ABOUT THE IUE SPECTRA

The IUE spectra consists of two segments obtained, respectively, with
the short wavelength camera (SWS), covering the spectral range
1150-2000A at 5A spectral resolution, and the long-wavelenght camera
(LWS), covering the spectral range 1900-3300A at 8A spectral
resolution.  In some cases, one spectral region (most often the SWS)
is missing, because the data were not available or of poor
quality. The quality of the data decreases towards the end of each
spectral segment, which is often noticeable in the overlap region
around 2000A.

We have edited out from the spectra the strong geocoronal
Lyman alpha emission line, using a straigth line to connect
the two continuum points at both sides of the line.


REMARKS ABOUT THE SPECTRA OF THE SOUTHERN SAMPLE

The optical spectra of the southern sample were obtained with two
different telescopes and setups (see Storchi-Bergmann et al.,
reference above):

(1) The 3200-6400A range was observed with the CTIO 1m telescope and
2DFRUTTI detector, at a spectral resolution of 8A. The 2DFRUTTI had a
very good response in the blue but poor response towards the red. The
spectra thus have good signal-to-noise ratio in the blue, but poor
signal above 6000A. Above 6000A, there are also uncertainties in the
curvature of the spectra due to second order contamination from light
at lambda ~3000-3200A.

(2) The 6400-8200A and 8200-10000A wavelength ranges were observed
with the 1.5m telescope and a CCD detector, at a spectral resolution
of 5.5A.  Some nights were not photometric, and as a result, some of
the segments of the spectra have low S/N ratio; we decided to keep
them, as we could recover the average flux from the other segments of
the spectra.

In general there was a good agreement between the flux at the red end
of the UV spectra and at the blue end of the optical spectra. In a few
cases, however, the optical spectrum had to be scaled to match the UV
spectrum. Uncertainties may still remain in some cases where the
signal-to-noise at the end of the UV spectrum is poor.

REMARKS ABOUT THE SPECTRA OF THE NORTHERN SAMPLE

The optical spectra of the northern sample were obtained with the 0.9m
telescope at KPNO and the now retired Intensified Reticon Scanner
(IRS, see the McQuade et al. reference above), using a circular
aperture of 13.5". Because of the close match between the IUE and
optical apertures, no normalization between the UV and optical spectra
was required. Two separate gratings were employed to obtain the blue
(3200-5500A) and the red (5000-7500A) part of the spectra with
resolution of about 10A.
