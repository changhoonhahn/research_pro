Photoionization Grid for Starburst99 continuous burst model
with electron density of 10/cm^3.   

The grid was run by Lisa Kewley and is described in
Kewley et al. 2001, ApJ, 556, 121.

Naming convention for output files (gzipped)

type_metallicity_age_ionization-parameter_SB99_atm.ph4.gz

where type is either:
spec  = emission line list - gives wavelength and flux in each 
        emission line (this is the mos commonly used output file).
photn = ionizing conditions through the nebula at each step size 
        through the model.
phapn = plasma properties (eg., pressure, sound speed, Mag field)
phlss = information about energy conservation through the nebula
    
atm is either L = Lejeune et al. extended atmospheres (+ Kurucz atmospheres)
              K = Kurucz atmospheres
