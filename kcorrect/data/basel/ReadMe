Description:
    The present library provides an extensive and homogeneous grid of
    low-resolution theoretical flux distributions for a large range of
    stellar parameters : Teff=50,000K to K, logg=5.50 to -1.02 and
    [M/H]=-5.0 to +1.0. The library has been constructed from different
    grids of blanketed stellar atmosphere models (Bessell et al.
    (1989A&AS...77....1B, 1991A&AS...89..335B), Fluks et al.
    (1994, Cat. <J/A+AS/105/311>), Kurucz (1995, priv. comm.), Allard &
    Hauschildt (1995ApJ...445..433A). The models described in the
    accompanying paper (Lejeune et al. (1997A&AS..125..229L) are given
    here as part of a more extensive data set including M dwarf model
    spectra, which will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Lejeune et
    al., 1998, Cat. <J/A+AS/130/65>). A correction procedure has been
    applied to the theoretical energy in order to calibrate fluxes on
    empirical-temperature relations (see also Lejeune et al., 1998, Cat.
    <J/A+AS/130/65>). The library is given here in its two versions : the
    first one (files *.ori) containing the "original" flux distributions
    -- as given by the original grids of atmosphere models --, but
    rebinned on a common wavelength scale (see also Leitherer et al.
    1996PASP..108..996L) and the second one (files *.cor) which provides
    the "corrected" flux distributions. Each version of the library
    contains an ASCII file of models for each of the 19 values of the
    metallicity ([M/H]=-5.0, -4.5, -4.0, -3.5, -3.0, -2.5, -2.0, -1.5,
    -1.0, -0.5, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, +0.1, +0.2, +0.3, +0.5 and +1.0),
    named as lcbxxx.yyy, where xxx designates the metallicity (ex:
    'm15' --> [M/H]=-1.5), and yyy identifies the library version. For
    each model (out of the total of 8315 models), a flux spectrum is given
    for the (same) set of 1221 wavelength points covering the range 9.1 to
    160000 nm, with a mean resolution of 10{AA} in the UV and 20{AA} in
    the visible. In addition to the 19 metallicity files, two individual
    files originating from the Kurucz (1991, in Precision Photometry:
    Astrophysics of the Galaxy, Davis Philip A.G., Upgren A.R. & Janes
    K.A. (eds.). Schenectady, NY, L. Davis Press, Inc., 1991, pp. 27-44))
    models are given, lcbsun.ori and lcbvega.ori, which provide
    theoretical flux distributions for the Sun and Vega respectively.

     1-  153 8F10.1            Set of 1221 wavelengths (in nm)
   Blocks of model fluxes.
         154 2I6, 4F6.2        Each block contains in the first line an
                                identifier as follows
                                model number, Teff, logg, [M/H] , Vturb, xh
   155-  328 174(7E11.4)       1221 values of the blanketed emergent surface
   329           3E11.4         flux, expressed as flux moment (in mW/m^2^/Hz
                                or ergs/s/cm/cm/Hz), H_nu_
   329-82345 2I6,4F6.2/7E11.4  Repeating the above for maximum 466 other
                                Teff, logg and [M/H] values

Note about the parameters:
   Teff is the effective temperature
   logg the logarithm of the surface gravity
   [M/H] the metallicity
   Vturb the microturbulent velocity
   xh the mixing-length parameter
   For the M stars (Teff<3500K), the parameters Vturb and xh have no
     meaning here and have been arbitrary fixed to 0.0
Note about the units :
   As H_nu_ is expressed as flux moment in the units erg/s/cm^2^/Hz
    (SI: mW/m^2^/Hz),
   F_lambda_, in units ergs/s/cm^2^/Angstrom, must be calculated from
    H_nu_ using the equation
                  F_lambda_=0.4*H_nu_*c/lambda/lambda,                (1)
    where c=2.997925e17.......is the velocity of light and
    lambda........is the wavelength in nanometers (as tabulated at the
    beginning of each file lcbxxx.yyy)

The numerical factor of 0.4 (=4*0.1) in equation (1) above comes from the
 conversion of the flux moment into flux (*4) and from the conversion of flux
 per nanometer into flux per Angstrom (*0.1).

NOTICE however that F_lambda_ still is a surface flux; therefore, calculations
 of absolute luminosities for the present models require additional assumptions
 about the radii of the stars represented by the models.

Within each file, the individual models are listed with Teff increasing, and
 logg increasing at a given Teff.
