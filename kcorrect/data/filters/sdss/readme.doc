These files are the response functions as measured by Mamoru Jan 2001,
interpolated to fill in the sharp corner near the red cutoff using model
filters and then splined to a standard wavelengh set, shared by all of
the files in this set of response functions for all the telescopes.

The files indexed 0 are the response functions averaged over the six
columns of the camera.

The file sdssav.lis is a list of magnitudes (V=0) and colors for these
(average) response functions at 1.3 airmasses run against the
Gunn-Stryker spectrophotometric atlas stars and the AB95 standards. 
These are AB magnitudes, note, not whatever system we will come up with. 
To transform from USNO magnitudes to a natural SDSS AB system, the
best-guess transformations as of this writing are

u_AB = u' - 0.04 - 0.003*(u'-g')

g_AB = g'        + 0.069*(g'-r') 

r_AB = r'        + 0.038*(r'-i') 

i_AB = i'        + 0.049*(r'-i')

z_AB = z' - 0.01 + 0.011*(i'-z')

but these are based ENTIRELY on calculations, and should be much better
determined by observations shortly.
