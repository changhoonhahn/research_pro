I dont know how famous it is but I do have the extinction curve that I derived 
and use.  There are actually three parts to it.  The first is the overall 
extinction, the second is water vapor in the near infrared and the third 
are the oxygen A and B bands.  They are at low resolution  and are intended 
to be used with linear interpolation between points.  The last two are
not very accurate and both use a square root extinction law since the individuallines are highly saturated.

Below are the three  which are intended for use at Palomar.  The format is 
just a C array.

Here are the equations I use:
For water vapor

            temp=wex[1][j-1]+(((a[0][i]-wex[0][j-1])/(wex[0][j]-wex[0][j-1]))*
                   (wex[1][j]-wex[1][j-1]));
              a[2][i]=a[2][i]-sqrt(kwv*0.00100*temp*mean);

Here kwv is a scaling factor which is typically 1.0.

For oxygen

            temp=ox[1][j-1]+(((a[0][i]-ox[0][j-1])/(ox[0][j]-ox[0][j-1]))*
                   (ox[1][j]-ox[1][j-1]));
              a[2][i]=a[2][i]-sqrt(0.001*temp*mean);

I believe that in the above a[2][i] is the raw magnitude which is corrected 
then foe extinction in magnitudes.
