# Units:
#  "lambda" is in Angstroms
#  "pass" is the contribution to the detector signal per photon
#         entering the atmosphere of Earth
#
# Bandpass Name(s): [SPECIFY]
#
# Instrument: GalEx
# 
# Determined by: GalEx team (sent by David Schiminovich)
#
# Date of determination: 2003?
#
# Meaning of/Reason for default column: Only available

# Notes:
# 
# From Schiminovich:
#
# "In ground calibration, by measuring photon count rates of a
# monochromatic source and comparing to counts measured by a
# NIST-referenced photomultiplier tube.  At a given wavelength:
#
# Effective area=(Geometric open aperture)*(measured
# counts)*(phototube efficiency)/(phototube counts) 
# 
# Can determine zero-point from this.  We have compared to WD
# standards in-flight and believe our zero-point is less than 0.1 mag
# off, and will improve accuracy over the next few months (more
# calibrators are being observed).  Grism mode allows us to make some
# band shape determinations, however grism order efficiency enters
# into calculation.

# The units are "effective area" in cm^2
