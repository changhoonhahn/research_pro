This directory contains a number of filter responses 
from different astronomical instruments. Most of them include 
atmosphere. They are fully explained in their header documentation,
as is the format of the files. 

C-code which reads such a file, and returns the number of elements and
pointers to lambda and the response, is in the k_load_filter() routine 
included in the file $KCORRECT_DIR/src/k_load_filters.c

At this time, 2MASS, SDSS, and UK Schmidt filter curves are included.

Remember, the absolute values of the responses are arbitrary.
