# 
# From L. Moustakas:
#
# "This page provides access to the nominal bandpass functions used for
# GOODS imaging data. The bandpass files are simple ascii tables with
# names *.bp ("bp" = "bandpass"), where * is some descriptive name for the
# filter. The first column gives wavelength in Angstroms (regardless of
# the original source for the information), and the second column gives
# the bandpass transmission. To the extent possible, the transmission
# values are absolutely normalized, and include as many elements of the
# total system throughput (including filter, detector QE, optics, and
# sometimes atmospheric transmission where important) as possible. In some
# cases (e.g., Spitzer/MIPS), the only bandpass functions available were
# pre-normalized to a peak value of 1, and so do not record the actual
# total throughput.
# 
# In many cases, a fair amount of effort has gone into deriving the
# appropriate bandpass functions from various throughput components.
# However, in some cases there is uncertainty about some of the throughput
# elements, or the appropriate procedures for combining them. The links
# from the first column of the table below provide information about where
# the bandpass functions were obtained, or how they were constructed."
