Filter curves used in the CTIO/MOSAIC-II optical (Ugriz) imaging of
the CDFS/SWIRE field downloaded from B. Siana's webpage:
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~bsiana/cdfs_opt/filters.html

Several empirical corrections have been applied to these filter
curves, as described at the above page, including:

"The following table incorporates several corrections to the filter and
CCD QE curves...

* A 15 A shift blueward was applied to all filter curves to convert
  from a curve measured in parallel light to the f/2.9 beam of the
  CTIO 4-meter.

* An average of all 8 CCD QEs was used. The wavelength resolution of
  the reported QE for MOSAIC-II leaves much to be desired. However,
  the QE agreed well with the much better measurements for MOSAIC-I
  redward of ~4500 A. We therefore used these data to interpolate
  between the CTIO MOSAIC-II points.

* The CTIO 4-m prime focus corrector does not transmit below 3300 A so
  an artificial cutoff was put there in the QE curve.
