# Units:
#  "lambda" is in Angstroms
#  "pass" is the contribution to the detector signal per photon
#         entering the atmosphere of Earth
#
# Bandpass Name(s): [SPECIFY]
#
# Instrument: Hypothetical system developed to match known "standards"
#             of Johnson/Cousins to spectrophotometry
# 
# Determined by: M. S. Bessell
#
# Date of determination: 1990
#
# Meaning of/Reason for default column: Only available
#
# Notes:
#
# These filter curves define the "official" Johnson/Cousins BVRI
# system, as far # as I am concerned. One must take care to make sure
# that you really want these filters; ie. that the observations have
# been converted into this system. Otherwise, you will have to use
# custom filter curves (which may not be a bad idea).

# Details of how/why this system is defined can be found in:

# Read it; it will give you a good insight into how complex this 
# whole business really is.
