About as much info as we are going to get. The real issue is how well one
can calculate a pseudo-bj mag from a spectrum, this strikes me as quite complex
as the real bj response is non-linear but has been linearised in some fashion
against CCD mags

Hi Karl,

This curve seems to be generating a lot of interest recently - I had an
e-mail with Michael Blanton about it last month. Perhaps I should publish
a version based on the 20 or so plates for which I have data - needs some
effort on my part.

The numbers do indeed reflect energy response - ie the curve was
calculated using spectra calibrated in erg/s/cm^2/A. You can clearly
modify the transmission curve to equate to a photon counting device
easily. The differences in the magnitudes turn out to be surprisingly
small however and, unless you have some pretty odd SEDs, will be
smaller than the uncertainties associated with the plate-to-plate
variations in the response. Thinking about it, you may well have
some odd SEDs so my observation may be optimistic.

Regards

Paul
