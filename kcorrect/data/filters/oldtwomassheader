# Units:
#  "lambda" is in Angstroms
#  "pass" is the contribution to the detector signal per photon
#         entering the atmosphere of Earth
#
# Bandpass Name(s): [SPECIFY]
#
# Instrument: 2MASS Cameras in Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and CTIO, Chile

# Determined by: 2MASS team; notes on the web page are:

#   "We thank Martin Cohen for providing us with the NICMOS3 data
#    (originally from the manufacturer Rockwell, as obtained by Leslie
#    Hunt), the atmospheric models, and the resulting total response
#    curves.

# Date of determination: Unknown (see previous note for upper limit)

# Notes:
#
# These curves obtained from:
#
# http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/sec3_1b1.tbl12.html
# 
# Apparently the differences between the two sites are small enough
# that the 2MASS folks choose to ignore it.  
# 
# According to the web pages, these curves include mirror
# reflectivity, dewar window transmission, camera coatings, dichroic
# effects, filters, detector QE, as well as "representative
# atmospheric transmission at the observatory sites." The quantum
# efficiencies appear to have been determined from the NICMOS3 array
# "similar to those used in the 2MASS cameras". They do not make 
# clear on the site whether they used the ATRAN or PLEXUS atmospheric
# models.
#
# I am not in a position to judge the quality of these curves, but
# have no reason to doubt them.
