# Units:
#  "lambda" is in Angstroms
#  "pass" is the contribution to the detector signal per photon
#         entering the atmosphere of Earth
#
# Bandpass Name(s): b_j (NOT B_j!)
#
# Instrument: UK Schmidt telescope optics, IIIaJ emulsion 2mm  
#             plus 2mm of GG395. Airmass included
# 
# Determined by: P. Hewett & S. J. Warren (private communication 2002, see
#   correspondence in ukschmidt directory); Blanton divided by 
#   lambda to obtain photon probability
#  
# Date of determination: Unknown (see correspondence for upper limit)
#
# Meaning of/Reason for default column: Only available.
#
# Notes:
#
# Please read the correspondence in the ukschmidt directory for
# explanations of how this was determined. Note that it was determined
# for a single photographic plate; Hewett does not trust that the
# curve is repeatable at a high level of precision. That said, this 
# is all we have got. Furthermore, this response appears to reproduce
# the behavior of galaxy b_j magnitudes relative to B and V galaxy
# magnitudes (b_j-B = -0.28 (B-V)). 
# 
# I don't understand how plate nonlinearities figure into this curve;
# presumably the hope is that this respresents the response for the 
# appropriately linearized b_j magnitude, for some definition of 
# "appropriately".
